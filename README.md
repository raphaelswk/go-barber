## :bookmark: About
GoBarber is a barbershop management system where barbers can share their availability and customers are able to schedule service base on it.
This was the main project created during GoStack bootcamp offered by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a 3 months bootcamp where attendees were able to learn TypeScript, Node.js, React and React Native. This project is split in 2 different folders one for REST API and other for Web Application, here are the links to them:

- [REST API](https://github.com/raphaelswk/go-barber/tree/main/gobarber-backend)
- [Web client](https://github.com/raphaelswk/go-barber/tree/main/gobarber-web)
